            <p>
                East Central University of southern Oklahoma is my alma mater. 
                I was able to achieve a degree in computer science, with a minor 
                in Russian language studies. I would say overall I enjoyed my time
                at university, but there are things I wish I would've done or could've
                done. However, that doesn't mean that I can't! Continuing education is a
                big part of who I am. Whether that's my continued study of foregin languages,
                pursuit of various certifications or just my study of mathematics for pleasure
                learning is a deeply important part of who I am.
