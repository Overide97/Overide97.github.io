            <p>
                East Central University of southern Oklahoma is my alma mater. 
                I was able to achieve a degree in computer science, with a minor 
                in Russian language studies. I would say overall I enjoyed my time
                at university, but there are things I wish I would've done or could've
                done. However, that doesn't mean that I can't! Continuing education is a
                big part of who I am. Whether that's my continued study of foregin languages,
                pursuit of various certifications or just my study of mathematics for pleasure
                learning is a deeply important part of who I am.

                While at university, I also had the opportunity to be the president of the ECU
                Russian club for four years. It was an honor, and I learned about leadership
                through that role, and it helped me learn how to ask others for help and not
                be so afraid of making mistakes, as long as I learned. I was also a member of 
                the national slavic honor society Dobro Slovo, and was the president of it as
                well for two years.

                Outside of college, I have acheived a certificate in data analytics from Coursera
                through Google. This taught me about the data analysis process, from asking questions,
                to taking action with the data that you've aquired. A few youtube videos about data analytics
                got me into the idea of it, but this course really got me actively using it in my everday life.
                It helps me in little ways everyday, and it can help anyone if they pay attention. The most
                life altering thing it has done for me has to be the amazing amount of weight I've lost.
