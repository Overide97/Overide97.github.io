                    <br>
                    <p>I created this for Citzen's Bank of Ada. While there
                        a coworker explained to me how they didn't like having
                        to fill out the adobe reader, as they were having trouble
                        navigating it. I learned later that it wasn't just her, but
                        others as well had issues with the adobe form. Not navigating it,
                        but due to the fact that they would have to add new pages for maybe
                        a small section of the page, like needing just one more merchant.
                        They also lacked the ability to create a new page easily using the 
                        resoureces available to them.

                    <br>
                    <p>This is a personal project of mine. I record my study times
                        and the different categories that they fall into. This allowed 
                        me and still does allow me to visually see how I'm doing, and what 
                        areas I'm lacking in. It also allows me to know just how many hours
                        I've actually commited to a particular area of study.

                    <p>Documenting my weight loss journey, has allowed me to visually see my progress.
                        It's extremely easy to become discouraged doing something like this, and for me
                        at least data makes it easier. It also doesn't lie, and lets me know that I'm really
                        improving. For a long time I struggled to lose weight, but through the power of data 
                        I really started making progress.

                    <p>During and after my education at my university, 
                        I helped teach children at the library in an afterschool program.
                        I would help with the lessons and keeping the children engaged in learning.
                        There isn't really anything I have to showcase this, other than the fact that I 
                        did it. Regardless, it feels important to me, and it meant a lot to me being able
                        to share language and culture with kids who wanted to learn.

                        for me, but I was allowed to present at their conferences and even get my works published
                        as a student article in their academic journal.
