    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h4>Web Development</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fraud Dispute Form</li>
        <p>I created this for Citzen's Bank of Ada. While there
            a coworker explained to me how they didn't like having
            to fill out the adobe reader, as they were having trouble
            navigating it. So I made this for them to have an easier time
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="../CBA/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> in order to take a look at it.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Electric Vampire</li>
        <p>This is a website I'm developing for my friend who is
            currently getting into film and cinema as a serious hobby.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Data Analytics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Self Study</li>
        <p>This is a personal project of mine. I record my study times
            and the different categories that they fall into. This allowed 
            me and still does allow me to visually see how I'm doing, and what 
            areas I'm lacking in. It also helps me to not overly focus on one
            area over another.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Language</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Russian Language Program</li>
        <p>During and after my education at my university, 
            I helped teach children at the library in an afterschool program.
            I would help with the lessons and keeping the children engaged in learning.
