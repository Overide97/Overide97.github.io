                                Using the API provided by openweathermap.og 
                                I created a weather app. You can simply type in a city
                                and hit either search or enter, and it will display the temperature,
                                humidity, windspeed and cloudiness for the city. This was a fun project,
                                and I'm still working to improve it with styling. It allowed me to start 
                                experimenting with using fetch.

                                I created this for Citzen's Bank of Ada. While there
                                a coworker explained to me how they didn't like having
                                to fill out the adobe reader, as they were having trouble
                                navigating it. I learned later that it wasn't just her, but
                                others as well had issues with the adobe form. Not navigating it,
                                but due to the fact that they would have to add new pages for maybe
                                a small section of the page, like needing just one more merchant.
                                They also lacked the ability to create a new page easily using the 
                                resoureces available to them.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, though they liked the website, and the head of IT commented
                                on how slick it looked, they decided not to implement the website. This
                                was because of sustainability. When I'm not there, there wouldn't be anyone
                                to update the form. The same problem had happened before with others who had
                                worked on things that were no longer there. They didn't want to implment it, to
                                potentially have to go back to something like an Adobe form in a few years.

                                currently getting into film and cinema as a serious hobby.
                                I haven't done much with it, so it isn't going to be displayed yet. 
                                Once there is more work done, I will have it displayed here on my projects page.

                        I like Dungeons and Dragons, and while being the dungeon master and working, I noticed I didn't always
                        have time to create worlds and entire populations. I decided to use Python to solve my problem. This code
                        will generate five thousand different NPCs for my campaign. Since this takes place in Saltmarsh on The Sword Coast in
                        The Forgotten Realms, I decided to also make sure that the weights accurately refelct that. Halflings are
                        more likely to be farmers, and the most common jobs that you will find in town will involve the local fishing trade.
                        It also factors in the fictional ethnicities of the setting as well, for every race, along with their age and gender.
                        If they end up an adventurer, it will take that into account and give them a class such as fighter or wizard.

                            This is a personal project of mine. I record my study times
                            and the different categories that they fall into. This allowed 
                            me and still does allow me to visually see how I'm doing, and what 
                            areas I'm lacking in. It also allows me to know just how many hours
                            I've actually commited to a particular area of study. For this though,
                            I'm going to include information regarding my journey back into programming
                            after a long break since the end of university.

                            Documenting my weight loss journey, has allowed me to visually see my progress.
                            It's extremely easy to become discouraged doing something like this, and for me
                            at least data makes it easier. It also doesn't lie, and lets me know that I'm really
                            improving. For a long time I struggled to lose weight, but through the power of data 
                            I really started making progress. I was able to see where I was having issues, and tackle them.

                                I helped teach children at the library in an afterschool program.
                                I would help with the lessons and keeping the children engaged in learning.
                                There isn't really anything I have to showcase this, other than the fact that I 
                                did it. Regardless, it feels important to me, and it meant a lot to me being able
                                to share language and culture with kids who wanted to learn.

                                for me, I struggle A LOT, but I was allowed to present at their conferences and even get my works published
                                as a student article in their academic journal.
