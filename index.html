            <p>
              I'm an independant worker and though I'm introverted 
              I enjoy teamwork and the and working with others to acheive something greater
              than myself. I'll say it all the time, but I love to learn, especially
              skills that lead to the creation of something.
          </p>

            I have a huge passion for data, and how it can help us interact with the
            world around us. I truly believe that every human being, regardless of who
            they are, can benefit from the data of their everyday lives. It's incredible
            how much data we absorb everyday without realizing it, and if you actually
            pay attention to it, and choose to learn from it, the possibilities are 
            almost endless.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Computer science and programming are another passion that I have, and I 
            really enjoy it because of the challenge it presents. Turning nothing into
            something is an aweseom feeling, especially after working through a really
            difficult set of problems.
          </p>
          <br>

            My final passion is linguistics and just the overall study of languages. This
            passion began while I was in college. I took a Russian language class to both
            challenge myself and learn about another culture I'd only ever known through
            pop culture and propoganda. It led to me attending language learning conferences
            and even writing small academic articles.
