            <p>
              I like to think of myself as an independant worker and though I'm introverted 
              I enjoy teamwork and the and working with others to acheive something greater
              than myself. I'll say it all the time, but I love to learn. Learning allows me
              to create, it allows me to enjoy things I otherwise wouldn't, it allows me to become
              a better person, not just because of the knowledge I gain, but because of how it
              might one day help those around me.
          </p>

            I have a huge passion for data, and how it can help us interact with the
            world around us. I truly believe that every human being, regardless of who
            they are, can benefit from the data of their everyday lives. It's incredible
            how much data we absorb everyday without realizing it, and if you actually
            pay attention to it, and choose to learn from it, the possibilities are endless.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Computer science and programming are another(other) passion(s) that I have, this
            is because of the challenges I'm presented. Turning nothing into
            something is an aweseom feeling, especially after working through a really
            difficult set of problems. It allows me to think creatively and find some peace,
            especially after a particuarlly tough day.
          </p>

            My final passion is linguistics, the study of languages, as well as studying foreign languages.
            I took a Russian language class to both
            challenge myself and learn about another culture I'd only ever known through
            pop culture and propoganda. It led to me attending language learning conferences
            and even writing small academic articles.
